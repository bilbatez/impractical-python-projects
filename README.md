Python projects based on Lee Vaughan's book and whatever things I want to create at the moment.

From the Book:

1. Silly Name Generator: generates Silly Names
2. Poor Man's Bar Chart: simple chart for character count
3. Pig Latin-ify: ityay oesday histyay
4. Palindromegram: finding palindrome and palingram in dictionary
5. Anagrams: anagram finder and anagram phrase constructor
6. Finding Voldemort: reduce anagrams produced by tmvoordle to manageable number
7. Route Transposition Cipher Decoder: decoding the route tranposition cipher

Random Things:

1. Fake Email Generator: Generate random email (no, it's not for malicious purpose)
